<h1 id="how-attachments-work">How Attachments Work</h1>
<p>The primary use case of the <strong>dataset</strong> tool is managing
JSON documents. There exist a common secondary use case of including
support for “attached” non-JSON documents. Example 1, when we harvest
content from a system who does not support JSON natively it is handy to
keep a version of the harvested content for audit purposes. The EPrints
system has a REST API that returns XML. Storing the original EPrint XML
document gives the developer an ability to verify that their JSON
rendering matches the EPrint XML should their JSON needs change in the
future.</p>
<p>This raises questions of how to keep things simple while supporting
an arbitrary number of attachments for JSON object document? How do you
handle versioning when some types of collections need it for attachments
and others don’t?</p>
<p>The <strong>dataset</strong> command line tool and related Go package
store the attachments based on the collection’s version seetings. By
default collections do not version JSON records or attachments. The
versions are incremented based on wither collection level versioning is
turned on as “patch”, “minor” or “major” version increments. This
setting, when set, will impact future JSON document or attachment
changes by incrementing the semver accordingly. The default version
number is “v0.0.0”, if patch level versioning is enabled it will mean
the next version stored is “v0.0.1”, if minor versioning is inabled then
the next version after “v0.0.0” is “v0.1.0”, if major version is inabled
then the next version after “v0.0.0” is “v1.0.0”. Not with the changes
to v2 of dataset you do not normally need to directly specify versions.
It just happens automatically when you change something. To turn off
versioning on the collection then you’d set the versioning value to an
empty string. Any historic versions remaining but future actions will
not be versioned.</p>
<h2 id="working-example">Working example</h2>
<p>We have a dataset collection called “Sea-Mamals.ds” with versioning
enabled at the patch level. We have a JSON object stored called
“walrus”. We want to attach “notes-on-walrus.docx” which is on our local
drive under “/Users/fred/Documents/notes-on-walrus.docx”.</p>
<p>Using the <strong>py_dataset</strong> you issue the follow command
–</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    from py_dataset import dataset
    c_name = &quot;Sea-Mammals.ds&quot;
    key = &quot;walrus&quot;
    # NOTE: the default version is &#39;v0.0.0&#39;, we&#39;ll be incrementing
    # the patch level with is the last zero.
    obj = &#39;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;may have tusks&quot;, &quot;size&quot;: &quot;impressive&quot;}&#39;
    if not dataset.status(c_name):
        dataset.init(c_name)
    if not dataset.create(c_name, key, obj)
        print(f&#39;failed to create {key}, {dataset.error_message()}&#39;)
        exit()
    if not dataset.attach(c_name, key, [ &#39;/Users/fred/Documents/notes-on-walrus.docx&#39;])
        print(f&#39;failed to attach to {key}, {dataset.error_message()}&#39;)
        exit()</code></pre>
<p>If you looked on the file system where the collection resides you’ll
see an attachments sudirectory, a pair tree path ending in a directory
holding the attachment base name, the value of the attach will be named
“v0.0.1”, “v0.0.2”, etc depending up the updates made to it. It is a
naive version system and does NOT perform diffs between the objects.
This is really important because if you store a 2 Gig object then store
new version of of a 2Gig object you need to have enough file system room
for both copies!!!</p>
<pre><code>    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/walrus.json
    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docs/v0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>In this example the metadata for the attachment is updated in the
walrus.json file.</p>
<p>If we had added our attachment including a semver the directory
structure will be slightly more complex.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    if not dataset.attach(c_name, key, [ &#39;/Users/fred/Documents/notes-on-walrus.docx&#39; ]):
        print(dataset.error_message())</code></pre>
<p>This will cause additional sub directories to exist (if they haven’t
be created before). When you detach the “notes-on-walrus.docx” file is
detaches as “notes-on-walruls.docs” and does not include the version
number.</p>
<pre><code>    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/walrus.json
    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docx/v0.0.1
    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docx/v0.0.2</code></pre>
<p>If we later add a v0.0.3 of “notes-on-walrus.docx” it’d looks
like</p>
<pre><code>    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/walrus.json
    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docx/v0.0.1
    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docx/v0.0.2
    Sea-Mamanls/pairtree/wa/lr/us/notes-on-walrus.docx/v0.0.3</code></pre>
<p>All the metadata about the files attached are stored in the primary
attachments sub directory in a pairtree. This is tree even when you use
a SQL store for storing JSON documents.</p>
<p>NOTE: As of v2 <strong>dataset</strong> attachment versioning is
automatic if set for the collection.</p>
<p>If you want good version control is is recommended NOT to use dataset
versioning but instead opt for a proven solution like Git, Subversion or
ZFS. Dataset versioning is highly experimental.</p>
<p>NOTE: The href in the attachments metadata always points at the last
attached version.</p>
