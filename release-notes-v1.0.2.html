<h1 id="release-note-for-v1.0.2-release">Release note for v1.0.2
release</h1>
<h2 id="changed-integrations">Changed integrations</h2>
<p>The v2 development branch saw fundamental changed to the operation of
dataset collection. It was a substantial rewrite of v1 abstracting how
JSON objects are stored and versioned. v2 of datasat supports storing
the JSON objects in a pairtree as well as leveraging SQL JSON support in
SQLite3, MySQL 8 and PostgreSQL 14.</p>
<p>The v2 development branch of dataset supports a different approach to
version. This versioning can happen for both dataset records and for
attachments. Version if enabled isn’t intended to be directly
manipulated from libdataset derived libraries. The versioning approach
is highly experimental and will likely change implementation in the v2
branch as it gets used or abandoned. Versioning itself is set at the
collection level, impacts both attachments and the JSON objects stored
and will increment the version numbers either at the patch, minor or
major semver values across the collection. Ideally if versioning is
enabled (it is not by default) versioning happens automatically.</p>
<p>The metadata JSON documents in the root collection folder have
significantly changed between v1 and v2 of dataset. Metadata about the
collection itself is now stored as a codemeta.json file in the root
folder. Metadata needed to operation dataset is stored in a document
called “collection.json”. There is a pairtree supporting storage of
attachments called “attachments”, attachments can be versioned. There is
a directory called “frames” that stores data frames.</p>
<p>In dataset v2 the objects stored are no longer modified to include
references to attachments and keys. If you need need explicit id
attributes you need to modify the object before calling create or
update. This means some of the conformance testing has changed.</p>
<p>Since the <code>_Key</code> value is no longer injected into the
object you need to provide data frames with an explicit object id if you
wish that data exposed in the frame.</p>
<h2 id="dropped-integrations">Dropped integrations</h2>
<p>py_dataset no longer supports the v1.1 branch of dataset development.
It now supports v2 branch of dataset development with the
re-introduction of libdataset in v2.1. This allows us to integrate both
a pairtree storage system for curating JSON document collections as well
as use SQL engines supporting JSON columns such as SQLite 3, MySQL 8 and
recent versions of PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="changed-function-names">Changed function names</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>init()</code> now takes two parameters, the first is the name
of collection the second is a “dsn” value (i.e data source name as URI).
If the dsn value is an empty string init will create a pairtree store
collection (similar to v1 dataset collections). If a dsn URL is passed
then it store the JSON documents in a SQL JSON column. Currently
SQLite3, MySQL 8 and PostgreSQL 14 are supported. The attachements and
frames are defined in the file system but under different directories
than in v1 dataset.</li>
<li><code>frames()</code> (for listing available frames) became
<code>frame_names()</code></li>
<li><code>frame_exists()</code> (for checking if a frame is defined)
became <code>has_frame()</code></li>
<li><code>key_exists()</code> (for checking if a key is defined) became
<code>has_key()</code></li>
<li><code>read()</code> nolonger takes a third parameter for
<code>clean_object</code>, in v2 of dataset the JSON stored is NOT
modified on create or update.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-return-values">Changes in return values</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>doc_path()</code> returns an empty string for non-pairtree
dataset v2 collections (there is no document path since the JSON
document is stored in a relational database).</li>
<li><code>get_version()</code> returns the dataset version used to
create/manage a collection, not the collection’s own version. Metadata
for a collection is maintained in a codemeta.json document in the
collection’s root folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dropped-functions">Dropped functions</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>key_filter()</code> and <code>key_sort()</code> have been
removed to changes in collections and additional storage systems
(e.g. pairtree stores and sql JSON stores) _ <code>make_objects()</code>
is dropped, use <code>create_objects</code> instead</li>
<li><code>set_version()</code> is dropped, Namaste isn’t being used for
collection metadata, update the codemeta.json file instead</li>
<li><code>set_who()</code>, <code>set_what()</code>,
<code>set_where()</code>, <code>get_who()</code>,
<code>get_what()</code> and <code>get_when()</code> dropped, Namaste
isn’t being used for metadata on collections, update the codemeta.json
file instread</li>
<li><code>frame_grid()</code> has been dropped, work with frame lists
and do you table conversion in Python (e.g. use Python’s excellent data
science libraries)</li>
</ul>
